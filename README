Assignment 2 of COMP3331 UNSW (Networks): Overall mark 10/10

Working with sockets (all nodes send and receive) and graph theory. 

Threads isn't actually necessary in Python sockets as Python 
automatically stores things in buffers when no one is listening.

EXAMPLE:

Node 1 sends "Hello" ---> Node 2 (currently busy)

After node 2 becomes unbusy

Node 2 reads from socket ---> "Hello" (buffered by Python)

Graph theory: Dijsktra's algorithm and printing out path route
(somewhat tricky).

Sockets: Sending receiving packets, formatting packets, translating to information (regex), underlying network theory.
